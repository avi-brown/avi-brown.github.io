First Journal Entry
This is my first published journal entry. Everything between the --- markers will become a blog post.

I can write multiple paragraphs here and they'll be preserved in the HTML output.
---

This text won't be published because it doesn't have opening and closing --- markers.

Another Published Entry
This is another entry that will be published.

Each --- separated block becomes its own blog post with the first line as the title.

Hi Leora

That was fun

This is how I will quit X

This blog is just a plain text file on my computer.
It looks like this:


@imgs/blog_screenshot.png --medium


I set it up with Sonnet 4's help. Basically:
- I write blogs separated by three dashes
- I push to main
- GitHub actions trigger a parser and index.html is generated


I will start posting quick thoughts here instead of X.
